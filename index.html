            <img src="carmela_art_room.jpg" alt="Carmela's Art Room">
            <p>"Manny and the Tools were a big help cleaning out my art studio, though Felipe *did* accidentally recycle my sculpture! ðŸ˜… But they made up for it by handling the new electric sign, even when there wasnâ€™t any power where it needed to go. Quick thinking and always reliableâ€”just watch out for that recycling bin next time, Felipe!" - <strong>Carmela</strong></p>
