            <h3>Carmela's Review</h3>
            <img src="carmela_art_room.jpg" alt="Carmela's Art Room">
            <p>"Manny and the Tools were a big help cleaning out my art studio, though Felipe *did* accidentally recycle my sculpture! 😅 But they made up for it by handling the new electric sign, even when there wasn’t any power where it needed to go. Quick thinking and always reliable—just watch out for that recycling bin next time, Felipe!" - <strong>Carmela</strong></p>

            <h3>Mr. Lopart's Review</h3>
            <img src="mr_lopart.jpg" alt="Mr. Lopart’s Shop">
            <p>"Well, I suppose Manny and his Tools *did* help out in my shop when I needed it, but I could’ve done it myself, you know! 😤 They were quick and efficient, and I can’t complain about the quality of their work. Still, they could’ve let me handle it—it’s not like I needed all that *fancy tool work*. All in all, Manny did a good job, but next time, I’ll probably just fix it myself. After all, no one knows my shop like I do!" - <strong>Mr. Lopart</strong></p>

            <h3>Kevin and Nelson’s Mom’s Review</h3>
            <img src="kevin_nelson.jpg" alt="Kevin and Nelson’s Bunk Bed">
            <p>"Manny built a beautiful bunk bed for my boys, and now we finally have space for Grandma! The boys love it, and it’s sturdy and safe. 😍 However, I was hoping to get a *little* discount—after all, we’re regular customers! 😠 Manny did good work, but next time, he should think about giving *better price* for family. Still, very good job. Boys happy. Grandma happy. I guess I am happy too… mostly!" - <strong>Kevin and Nelson’s Mom</strong></p>

            <h3>Francisco’s Review</h3>
            <img src="horse_flat.jpg" alt="Francisco’s Flat Tire">
            <p>"Well, partner, let me tell ya, Manny saved my hide! 🐎 I was on my way to the horse show, and wouldn’t ya know it—flat tire on Estrella’s trailer! I thought I was plum outta luck. But Manny came in faster than a jackrabbit on a hot skillet, fixed that tire, and got me back on the road quicker than you can say 'yee-haw!' 🤠 And when that drawbridge got stuck? Shoot, Manny fixed it up like a true hero. I swear, this fella could rope the wind if he tried! Couldn’t be more thankful—this man’s the best!" - <strong>Francisco</strong></p>
